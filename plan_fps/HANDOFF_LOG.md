## 2026-04-24 - Playable plan system creation

- status: created
- summary: Created `plan_fps/` as the active playable parity control center with 223 step files, shared logs, a validator, and validator tests.
- next_step: `00-001 Classify Existing Plan`

## 2026-04-24 - 00-001 classify-existing-plan

- status: completed
- agent: Claude Code
- model: claude-opus-4-7
- effort: max
- step_id: 00-001
- step_title: classify-existing-plan
- summary: Classified the old `plan_engine/` work as `mixed` and locked the classification as durable playable-plan data. Wrote `plan_fps/manifests/existing-plan-classification.json` (schema v1) pinning the mixed classification, decision link D-FPS-002, 167 completed steps across 18 phases with per-phase counts, evidence paths, and the playable-parity gap (required `bun run doom.ts` vs. current `bun run src/main.ts`, missing root `doom.ts`). Added focused test `test/plan_fps/existing-plan-classification.test.ts` (11 tests, 73 expects) that loads the manifest, locks schema version and classification, cross-checks per-phase counts against `plan_engine/MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`, verifies evidence paths exist on disk, verifies the `doom.ts` entry point does not exist, and verifies `package.json` start script matches the gap record.
- files_changed: plan_fps/manifests/existing-plan-classification.json; test/plan_fps/existing-plan-classification.test.ts; plan_fps/FACT_LOG.md; plan_fps/HANDOFF_LOG.md; plan_fps/MASTER_CHECKLIST.md; plan_fps/validate-plan.ts
- recovery_edit: Widened `parseChecklist` regex in `plan_fps/validate-plan.ts` to match both `[ ]` and `[x]` checklist markers. Without this, flipping `00-001` to `[x]` in `MASTER_CHECKLIST.md` (required to advance the Ralph loop) dropped the parseable step count to 222 and broke both `plan_fps/validate-plan.test.ts` and `bun run plan_fps/validate-plan.ts`. Step file titles remain `[ ]` and the validator still enforces that; only the checklist row regex was relaxed.
- tests_run: bun run format (Formatted 3 files); bun test test/plan_fps/existing-plan-classification.test.ts (11 pass, 0 fail, 73 expects); bun test plan_fps/validate-plan.test.ts (2 pass, 0 fail); bun run plan_fps/validate-plan.ts (Validated 223 playable parity steps, First step: 00-001); bun test (6344 pass, 0 fail, 687728 expects across 172 files); bun x tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json (clean)
- new_facts: F-FPS-006 (old plan classification and evidence paths)
- decision_changes: none (D-FPS-002 already accepts the mixed classification; no update needed)
- oracle_changes: none
- next_eligible_steps: 00-002 declare-plan-fps-control-center
- open_risks: none
